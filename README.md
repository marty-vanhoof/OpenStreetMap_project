# OpenStreetMap Project

This project uses data wrangling techniques in order to audit and clean some OpenStreetMap data for a geographical region that contains [Clarington, Ontario, Canada](http://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=11/43.9728/-78.6528).

I completed this project as part of Udacity's data analyst nanodegree.  A more detailed report is in [this repository](https://github.com/marty-vanhoof/OpenStreetMap_project/blob/master/OSM_Report.ipynb).
