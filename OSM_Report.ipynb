    "\n",
    "OpenStreetMap (OSM) is an open source project that volunteers work on in order to create a free editable map of the world.  It was created by Steve Coast in the UK in 2004, and is used by many organizations globally, including Craigslist, MapQuest, JMP statistical software, Red Cross, and many others:  http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/About_OpenStreetMap\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is stored in XML format.  Unfortunately, since the data is human entered, the data quality can often be an issue.  The purpose of this project is to examine, audit, and clean some of this data programmatically.  I do this by first parsing, auditing, and cleaning the data using Python's XML ElementTree module, and then converting it from XML to CSV format.  Once the data is in CSV format, it can then be uploaded to a database making it convenient to run SQL queries to answer a number of questions about my chosen map area."

    "### The Map\n",
    "\n",
    "The map I chose to work on is the region where I grew up:  Clarington, Ontario, Canada.  Clarington is a geographical region and a municipality in Ontario, Canada that consists of many smaller towns, villages, hamlets, etc.  In fact, I chose to download a bigger region than Clarington because I needed my dataset to be at least 50 MB in size.  I downloaded [this region](http://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=11/43.9728/-78.6528) by using the \"Overpass API\" option, which downloads the entire area displayed in the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 1:  Some Problems Encountered in the Map\n",
    "\n",
    "There were various issues that I found, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extra whitespace in street names, e.g. \"Concession Road  &nbsp;10\" versus \"Concession Road 10\"\n",
    "- Street name abbreviations such as Ave, St, Rd, etc.  Also, some abbreviations such as Rd E, which should be Road East\n",
    "- Badly formatted postal codes: &nbsp; In Canada, postal codes are formatted with capital letters but my OSM data contained some postal codes with lower case letters such as \"l1c 3k5\", which should be \"L1C 3K5\".  Furthermore, some postal codes have extra characters or no whitespace.\n",
    "- Some typos in city/town names, e.g. \"Bowmanville\" mistakenly spelled as \"Bowmanwille\".  Also, some inconsistency with city/town names such as \"City of Oshawa\" versus \"Oshawa\". \n",
    "- An ``` 'addr:housenumber' ``` tag with a missing ``` 'v' ``` value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Street Name Issues\n",

    "To clean the street names, I modified the ` 'update_street_name()' ` function from the relevant portion of Udacity's [data wrangling course](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd002/parts/0021345404/modules/316820862075461/lessons/5436095827/concepts/54446302850923#).\n",

There also must be a space separating the 3rd and 4th characters:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_codes_in_Canada.  After auditing the postal codes (see the accompanying ``` 'auditing_cleaning.py' ``` file), I found that there were a few problems such as lower-case character issues (e.g. \"l1c 2z2\"), postal codes without the required whitespace (e.g. \"L1H7K5\"), or a mixture of both problems (e.g. \"L1c2n4\").

    "There were also some problems with city name consistency, e.g. sometimes the city Oshawa was referred to as \"City of Oshawa\".  Now I'm not really sure what the standard practice is in OpenStreetMap, but I wanted to have consistent queries when I uploaded the data to a database, so I opted to change all the occurences of \"City of Oshawa\" to simply \"Oshawa\".  Similarly, there were three different labels for the town of Whitby:  \"Town of Whitby\", \"whitby\", and \"Whitby\".  I chose to change all of these to just \"Whitby\".  The code for doing these things is straightforward and is also included in the ``` 'update_city()' ``` function in the accompanying ``` 'auditing_cleaning.py' ``` file.\n",

    "### Way Tag with Missing House Number\n",

    "After getting an error trying to validate my transformed data against the provided schema, Myles Callan @ Udacity (who is amazingly helpful) suggested that the culprit should be a missing value from one of the dictionaries in the ``` 'nodes_tags' ``` list.  To find this missing entry, I ran the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for element in get_element(OSM_PATH, tags=('node', 'way')):\n",
    "    for tag in element.iter('tag'):\n",

    "            print tag.attrib\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code uses the Udacity-provided ``` 'get_element()' ``` function, and iterates over all the ``` 'tag' ``` tags of node and way elements.  If the ``` 'v' ``` attribute for a specific tag is the empty string or ``` None ```, then it prints the attribute dictionary for that tag.  The result was one tag that was the cause of the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{'k': 'addr:housenumber', 'v': ''}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution was to simply ignore this tag when processing the map.  It was a simple matter to add the required code to my ``` 'shape_element()' ``` function (see the accompanying ``` 'osm_to_csv.py' ``` file)."

    "I think this dataset still needs quite a bit of work. There are still a number of opportunities for cleaning the data.  First, there are problems with non-standard phone number formatting, as the following query reveals:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT sub.value FROM \n",
    "(SELECT key, value FROM nodes_tags UNION SELECT key, value FROM ways_tags) sub \n",
    "WHERE sub.key = 'phone'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several phone numbers formatted with dashes (e.g. 905-240-4424), several formatted without dashes (e.g. 905 697 8282), some with no space at all (e.g. 9054308400), and also other anomalies.  They should be formatted consistently and according to a set standard, probably this:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_numbers_in_Canada.  Fixing the phone numbers would probably not be very difficult, as it would just require writing another cleaning function in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing I would do is try to fix the 2 postal code issues that I mentioned above, ie. the 2 anomalies 'L1C' and 'L1C15E2'.  This could be done by digging deeper into the dataset, either with SQL queries, programmatically with Python, or just using \"find\" in textedit with the original OSM file.  Once the address or name is found for the offending postal codes, then we could simply check a database of postal codes in Ontario, Canada to find the right ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue with the postal codes is there seems to be far too few of them.  This is likely because the dataset is incomplete.  We would need to get a list or database of postal codes for residences, businesses, etc. and then edit the OSM data.  This is something I may want to work on in the future, if I have time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same issue is true with pizza places, as mentioned above (and likely many other places as well).  There are a number of pizza places in my area that don't exist in the map.  These would probably need to be manually updated.\n",
