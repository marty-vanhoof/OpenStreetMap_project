# OpenStreetMap Project

This project uses data wrangling techniques in order to audit and clean some OpenStreetMap data for a [geographical region](http://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=11/43.9728/-78.6528) that contains Clarington, Ontario, Canada.

I completed this project as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.  A detailed report of the auditing/cleaning process is given [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/marty-vanhoof/OpenStreetMap_project/blob/master/OSM_Report.ipynb).
